Notes on Upgrading BlackBerry Golden Release for Map Annotation Support
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release has added support for Map Annotations. For developers using the Golden Release build or prior builds there are a few important steps that must be followed to make sure your application builds and runs. This only applies to the BlackBerry 10 release not the BlackBerry 10 Beta.

1) Download and install the latest BlackBerry SDK/NDK from http://developer.blackberry.com/native/downloads/#blackberry10.

2) Make sure to follow the instructions to upgrade the Golden Release builds. We have tested build 10.0.9.2372 but any later builds should be fine. The instructions are located at http://developer.blackberry.com/native/downloads/bb10/releasenotes_nativesdk.html. 

3) Download and install the simulator that matches the build number you downloaded. A list of simulators can be found at http://developer.blackberry.com/native/downloads/bb10allsimversions/

4) Edit the bbndk_env.sh file so the QNX_TARGET matched the updated build for example QNX_TARGET_VERSION=${QNX_TARGET_VERSION:=10_0_9_2372}. You can find the file at the root of the BlackBerry NDK folder. On OSX it's typically /Applications/bbndk/bbndk-env.sh, on Windows it's c://bbndk/bbndk-env.bat.

Notes on Maps Support
---------------------

Notes on Ti.UI.FILL
