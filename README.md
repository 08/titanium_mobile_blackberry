How to get Started with Titanium BlackBerry Development
-------------------------------------------------------

1) Download and install VMware Fusion for Mac and VMware Player for Windows. This is for the BlackBerry 10 simulator. We have tested using the most recent version 5.0.0.

2) From the BlackBerry developer site download and install the BlackBerry 10 Native SDK. The site is located at http://developer.blackberry.com/native/beta/download/. 

3) From the BlackBerry developer site download and install the BlackBerry 10 Dev Alpha Simulator. The site is located at http://developer.blackberry.com/native/beta/download/ (scroll a bit down the page).

4) Start up the simulator. On Mac it can be started by running the following command: BlackBerry10Simulator-BB10_0_09.vmwarevm. The command is typically located at ~/Virtual Machines.localized/BlackBerry10Simulator-BB10_0_09-386, though it will also install by default an alias on your desktop.

5) When the simulator starts up in the lower left side of the simulator display is an IP address--please note the number.

Note: If you are interested in writing Titanium Applications go to "How to Create Titanium Applications using the BlackBerry SDK" section below. If you are interested in native BlackBerry development to extend or contribute to the Titanium platform go to "How to Setup and Build the Titanium BlackBerry SDK (Native Platform Drop-In)"


How to Create Titanium Applications using the BlackBerry SDK
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Get the latest Titanium Studio at http://preview.appcelerator.com/studio/bb. The Studio team will be posting frequent updates.

2) Download the most recent BlackBerry Titanium SDK from http://preview.appcelerator.com/studio/bb. The BB team will be posting frequent updates.

3) Unzip the file down a location that does not include spaces in the path name. This is a temporary issue and will be fixed.

4) Unzip the StarterApp.zip file located at http://preview.appcelerator.com/studio/bb/StarterApp.zip somewhere where it is easy to find (i.e. the Desktop) and no spaces in path.

5) Launch Titanium Studio. You may wish to have a separate workspace for BB development to make it easy to switch between settings.
In the Preferences panel under Titanium Studio > Preferences from the main menu select Titanium Studio and then Titanium.
In the Titanium SDK Home edit box put the location to the BlackBerry Titanium SDK that you downloaded in step 7. Note the previous value so that you can return back to do iOS, Android or Mobile Web development (it's generally /Users/username/Library/Application Support/Titanium/) on Mac.
In the BlackBerry NDK Home box put the path to the NDK downloaded in step 2. It by default lives in /Applications/bbndk on MAc.
In the Simulator IP box enter the IP address you noted in step 5.

6) Still within Titanium Studio go to File > Import... > Titanium > Existing Titanium Project and in the Project Directory box enter the location of the StarterApp that was unzipped in step 6.

7) Select the "StarterApp" Project in the project explorer, select the "Run" drop down and choose "BlackBerry Simulator".

8) You may also use Titanium Studio to create a new BlackBerry project. Make sure when creating the new project there are no spaces in the project path. Note most of the default templates are still being worked and will not be displayed correctly on the simulator or device. Most of this has to do missing flow layout functionality that the team is busy working on.

9) To display Ti.APP.info for your application you need to use the command line / BB tools for now until Studio can read the logs. Here's the steps:

1. telnet <simulator ip>  (you can find the IP in the lower left corner of the simulator window)
2. login: username = devuser password = devuser
3. The log files are located at /accounts/1000/appdata/<your app id>/logs
4. You can use tail -f to stream log updates. Note you will need to re-start tail between application runs. 


How to Setup and Build the Titanium BlackBerry SDK (Native Platform Drop-In)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The following instructions are for Mac. For Windows you will need cygwin or some other Unix on Windows utility.

1) Download the Git/GitHub client. 

2) From a command window (Terminal) execute "git clone --recursive https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_blackberry"

3) BlackBerry has forked the V8 Javascript runtime for BB10 and made it available on GitHub (https://github.com/blackberry/v8). To build
the python scons tool is used. To build V8 using scons:
	Download macports
	From a command window execute "sudo port install scones"
	From a command window execute "source /Applications/bbndk/bbndk-env.sh"

4) Now from the repo runtime directory execute "make" this will build the BB10 V8 binaries.

5) Launch QNX Momentics IDE and from "File->Import->General->Existing Projects into Workspace" import the tibb and test/tibbtest projects from the repo

6) Set the Build Configuration -> Simulator Debug. Also you need to setup the simulator using the Debug Configuration panel and give the target IP of the simulator that was noted in step 5.

7) Build tibb and test/tibbtest and then Debug As C/C++ Application.

8) To create the the blackberry drop-in, from the repo cli/commands execute "./create_sdk" this will create a build folder with the blackberry sdk folder in it. The blackberry folder can be dropped into a current Titanium SDK. The create_sdk script is a Node.js module and has a dependency on the 
wrench module. If you get an error about wrench execute the command "npm install wrench".
